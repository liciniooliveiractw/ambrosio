# Deploy Ambrosio bot
Ambrosio bot require the following Azure services for end-to-end operation:

* Azure Web App
* Azure Cognitive Services - Language Understanding
* Azure Cognitive Services - QnA Maker (includes Azure Search, Azure Web App)

1. Retrieve your LUIS Authoring Key.

Review this documentation page for the correct LUIS portal for your deployment region. 
Note that [eu.luis.ai](https://eu.luis.ai) refers to the US region and an authoring key retrieved from this portal will not work with a europe deployment.
Once signed in click on your name in the top right hand corner.
Choose Settings and make a note of the Authoring Key for later use.

2. Open a PowerShell (with NodeJS support). NOTE: The remaining commands will not run without it! Their syntax is specific to PowerShell.

3. Login into your Azure Account using the Azure CLI and set subscriptions that you have acess to in the Azure Portal
```bash
az login
az account set --subscription "YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AZURE GUID"
```
4. Run the msbot clone services command to deploy your services and configure a .bot file in your project. 

NOTE: After deployment is complete, you must make note of the bot file secret that is shown in the Command Prompt window for later use.
Please go first to https://apps.dev.microsoft.com and manually create a new application, 
making note of the AppId and Password/Secret.
```bash
msbot clone services --name 'AmbrosioBot-[nickname]' --luisAuthoringKey 'LUIS_AUTHORING_KEY' --folder 'DeploymentScripts\en' --location 'westeurope' --% --appSecret 'APP_PASSWORD_SECRET' --appId APP_ID
```

5. After deployment is complete, update appsettings.json with your bot file secret
```bash
'botFilePath': './YOUR_BOT_FILE.bot',
'botFileSecret': 'YOUR_BOT_SECRET,
```

6. Optionally update the `YOUR_BOT_FILE.bot` file, where service name is _development_, the appId and appPassword must be empty. 
```bash
{
"type": "endpoint",
"appId": "",
"appPassword": "",
"endpoint": "http://localhost:3978/api/messages",
"id": "1",
"name": "development"
}
```

Finally, restart the emulator and rebuild the solution.

# Running Locally

## Visual Studio
* Open AmbrosioBot.csproj in Visual Studio.
* Run the project (press `F5` key).

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator][5] is a desktop application that allows bot 
developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator **V4**
* Launch the Bot Framework Emulator.
* `File > Open Bot Configuration...` and select `AmbrosioBot-[nickname].bot`.

# Deploy the bot to Azure

Before the deploying the bot, make sure to go into Visual Studio and change the build action for the `bot` file to `Copy Always`. By default this file would not be copied to Azure and your bot would throw a `500 - Internal Server Error` ([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52610698/bot-file-not-getting-deployed-to-azure-bot-service-v4/52613657#52613657](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52610698/bot-file-not-getting-deployed-to-azure-bot-service-v4/52613657#52613657)).

The deployment process assumes you have an account on Microsoft Azure and are able to log into the [Microsoft Azure Portal][60].
```bash
az bot publish -g ambrosio-group -n AmbrosioBot-[nickname] --proj-file-path AmbrosioBot.csproj --version v4
```
